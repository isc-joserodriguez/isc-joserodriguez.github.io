**Full-Stack Tech Lead** with **7+ years** of experience building end-to-end web and mobile products. My strength lies in leading agile teams and translating business objectives into scalable and maintainable technical solutions.

## My Approach

I've reduced deployment times by implementing **CI/CD pipelines** with zero downtime, and migrated legacy monolithic systems to modern microservices-based architectures. As a technical leader, I coordinate multidisciplinary teams and act as a single point of contact with stakeholders, ensuring each sprint delivers real business value.

## Technical Expertise

My main stack includes:

- **Backend:** NestJS, Node.js, GraphQL, REST APIs
- **Frontend:** React, React Native, Next.js, Angular
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL with Prisma/TypeORM
- **DevOps:** AWS, Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Linux
- **Testing:** Jest, Cypress, Playwright

## Leadership & Mentorship

Passionate about **mentorship** and **talent development**. I've guided junior developers in their professional growth and mentored cohorts of 30+ students in Full Stack development bootcamps, designing practical challenges that significantly increased completion rates.

## Key Achievements

- 🚀 Reduced deployment time from days to minutes through CI/CD automation
- 🏗️ Migrated a PHP monolithic backend to NestJS + Prisma with zero downtime
- 🛠️ Created CLI tools that streamline complete environment deployments on AWS
- 💳 Integrated payment systems (Stripe) automating billing and subscriptions
- 👥 Coordinated teams of 5+ developers using agile methodologies

## Beyond the Code

Balance is essential for creativity and performance. Outside the tech world, I enjoy:

- 🎮 **Strategic video games** - I love those requiring critical thinking
- 🧩 **Dexterity puzzles** - From wooden puzzles to metal rings
- ♟️ **Chess** - Each game is a stimulating mental challenge
- 🔢 **Sudoku** - Perfect for exercising logic

## Currently

I work as **Tech Lead** at **Blackstone Studio**, where I lead the technical team and actively participate in developing solutions with modern technologies. I constantly seek opportunities to optimize processes, improve code quality, and boost team growth.
